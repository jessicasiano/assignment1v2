My name is Jessica Siano and I currently live in Phoenix, AZ, but I am originally from New York.  I am a high school and college math teacher and I enrolled in this program at OSU in order to be able to change careers.

#Programming Background
My first bachelors degree is in math, but my minor was computer science.  The classes I took back them were mostly Java based so there have been some differences than with this program, however so far I have found things to be relatively easy.
