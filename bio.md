My name is Jessica Siano and I currently live in Phoenix, AZ, but I am originally from New York.  I am a high school and college math teacher and I enrolled in this program at OSU in order to be able to change careers.
I have two dogs and two cats, and honestly since I work two jobs while I take two classes per quarter I don't really have a lot of time for hobbies.  For now, I am just working and doing this, and occasionally hanging out with my friends.
